- functions in solidity can't accept or return 2D arays
- now is a global variable alias of another global variable called block.timestamp - returns the current block's creation time
- Another limitation you’ll find in EVM smart-contracts is the inability to access data outside the “memory”, and “storage"
- We can make a call to an oracle that will tell us something about the outside world in a trustable way, and act on that data within the smart contract
- when working with multi-dimensional arrays: indexing is in “reversed” order from most languages during declaration only
